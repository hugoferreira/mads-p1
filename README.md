# Introduction

This is the problem description for the first [MADS](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/disciplinas_GERAL.FormView?P_ANO_LECTIVO=2012/2013&P_CAD_CODIGO=EIC0062&P_PERIODO=1S) hack-a-thon, taken place at [FEUP](http://www.fe.up.pt), Wednesday 26th September 2012. Please **follow the instructions** on this page and **read until the end**. News will be posted by twitter, so follow [@madshackathon](https://twitter.com/madshackathon).

# Hack-a-thon Description

During the recent efforts to make Portugal get out of its debt crisis, an investment has been made to build a diamond mining facility in [Alentejo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alentejo). Because we may run out of money to fund R&D before the end of this year, an underground survey technology was borrowed from "nuestros hermanos" and already implemented at the mining site. Hence, we have maps of all the mines.

The government has therefore initiated a public bidding to find the most promising contractor (such as you) that is able to route a Robot throughout the diamond mine, retrieve all the diamonds, avoid any obstacles (such as falling rocks), and lift the diamonds back to the surface.

Note, however, that the surveying technology is probably not perfect. It is possible we will discover more things underground that we did not expect. We will let you know as the bidding progresses. **The user stories will thus be given by the project owners at the start of each sprint.**

# Schedule

    16:00 Sprint 2
    17:30 Pause (Snacks)
    18:30 Sprint 3
    20:00 Sprint 4
    21:30 End
```

# Tools

The use of the following tools are compulsory for all groups:

* Programming Language: [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7u7-downloads-1836413.html)
* Testing Infrastructure: [JUnit](http://www.junit.org)
* Version Control System: [Git](http://git-scm.com) through [GitHub](https://github.com)
* Building System: [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) or [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) or [Ant](http://ant.apache.org) or [Sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org)
* Continuous Integration: [Travis](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/languages/java/) with [Github Integration](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/)
* Operating System: Any

The github project [should be initialized as a fork of this project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) (yes, the one you're reading). One member of the group should click the button (on the top right) that says "Fork". Then, choose your group folder and start developing there. **Do not make pull requests until after midnight**. After all [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests), this repository will act as a unified host to all projects.

If you don't know how to use git, you can download the excellent github graphical utilities:

* For [Windows](http://windows.github.com)
* For [Mac](http://mac.github.com)
* Linux users should use the command line :-)

# Group Formation

Groups should edit this file and add their group name, members, and github URL to the following list. Please remember that groups should have between 4 and 6 people. Should members have a twitter account, add it in front of the name, e.g.:
